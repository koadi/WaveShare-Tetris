WaveShare-Tetris
----------------

This is a Tetris game I made for use with the WaveShare Open 18F4520 development board.
It's full featured and somewhat well commented.

If you'd like to run this on WaveShare hardware, you'll need their LCD22 module, touchscreen 2.2" with SPI interface.

You'll also need to add pull-up resistors on the implemented Joystick lines because WaveShare, at least on my board, 
wired these directly to ground. Pull up jumpers I made: http://imgur.com/q60gK

Otherwise, if you'd like to use this on your own hardware you'll need to implement your own GLCD library with
similar interfaces to the ones in glcd.c. You'll also need input switches for Left, Right, Down, Rotate, and Pause.
